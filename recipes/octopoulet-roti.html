        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This "dish" will make you reconsider the very notion of cuisine, and even ask yourself "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet?"</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 chicken (fresh or frozen, thawed)</li>
            <li>1 octopus (dead)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon poultry seasoning, to taste</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>aluminum foil</li>     
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Close this page and consider this <a href="./roquefort-cake.html">other recipe instead</a></li>
            <li>Pre-heat oven at 400°C</li>
            <li>Check inside the chicken for giblets and other animals, remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>Are you really doing it? Ok, then rinse chicken inside and out with cold running water.</li>
            <li>Dry thoroughly inside and out with paper towel.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle salt and fresh ground pepper inside the cavity and all over the outside.</li>
            <li>Place chicken in a roaster.</li>
            <li>Loosely pack the octopus into the main cavity and let the tentacles out.</li>
            <li>Rub the butter all over the outside of the chicken making sure to cover the whole outside surface.</li>
            <li>Tuck the foil tightly to the chicken so it is touching the bottom of the roaster but not under the bird.</li>
            <li>Place the roaster on the middle rack of the oven and roast at 400f degrees for 85 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is well browned, remove to platter, cover with foil and let rest.</li>
            <li>I hope you did not really do any of that, except for the first step.</li>
        </ol>
